# NOTES.md

A consolidated list of everything not (yet) implemented, gathered from the
`note`/`TODO` annotations scattered through `zorkData.bxs` plus a pass over
`gameState.flags` to see which ones are ever actually set. See the README's
[What's not (yet)](README.md#whats-not-yet) section for the short version —
this is the long one, with pointers.

## Genuinely unimplemented

### Other single-item gaps
- `teeth`, `wall`, `granite_wall` (`zorkData.bxs:72,77,82`) — ZIL
  `GLOBAL-OBJECTS` scenery kept for vocabulary/flavor only; intentionally
  not wired to any room.

## Implemented despite having a `note`

A few objects carry a `note` that's just situational context, not a gap:

- `trap_door` (`zorkData.bxs:300`) — revealed by pushing the rug; this
  works, the note just explains the mechanism.
- `grate` (`zorkData.bxs:386`) — hidden until spotted from the Grating Room
  below, then unlockable with the skeleton key; this works.
- `large_bag`/`stiletto` (`zorkData.bxs:401,406`) — held by the thief until
  he's defeated, then reachable; this works (combat is implemented).
- `axe` (`zorkData.bxs:329`) — held by the troll until defeated, then on
  the ground; this works.
